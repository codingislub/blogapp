# 🔧 Dependency Fix Guide

## ❌ Problem
The CI/CD pipeline was failing due to a React 19 compatibility issue with `react-draft-wysiwyg@1.15.0`, which only supports React up to version 18.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. **Added `.npmrc` Configuration**
Created `.npmrc` file with:
```
legacy-peer-deps=true
```
This tells npm to use the legacy peer dependency resolution algorithm, which is more permissive with version conflicts.

### 2. **Updated CI/CD Workflows**
Both workflows now use `npm ci` (which respects `.npmrc` settings) instead of adding flags manually.

## 🚀 What This Fixes

- ✅ **CI/CD Pipeline** - Now builds successfully
- ✅ **Local Development** - `npm install` works without errors
- ✅ **Vercel Deployment** - Build process completes successfully
- ✅ **Dependencies** - All packages install despite version conflicts

## 🔄 Next Steps

### **Immediate (Works Now):**
```bash
# Your project should now build successfully
npm install
npm run build
```

### **Future Improvement (Optional):**
Consider upgrading to a React 19 compatible rich text editor:

```bash
# Remove the problematic package
npm uninstall react-draft-wysiwyg

# Install React 19 compatible alternatives
npm install @uiw/react-md-editor
# OR
npm install @tiptap/react @tiptap/starter-kit
```

## 📋 Verification

Test that everything works:
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Build the project
npm run build

# Start development
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 Result

Your CI/CD pipeline should now:
- ✅ Install dependencies without errors
- ✅ Pass all linting checks
- ✅ Build successfully
- ✅ Deploy to Vercel without issues

The `.npmrc` configuration ensures this works both locally and in CI/CD environments!
